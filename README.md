Migrating a ROS2 C++ or Python Node to an RTMaps Component
==========================================================

This repo explains how to convert a basic C++ or Python ROS2 publisher/subscriber node into equivalent RTMaps components using the RTMaps API.  
We use the example of a minimal publisher that emits a string periodically and a minimal subscriber that displays the string.

You can find the C++ and Python examples in their respective directories.
